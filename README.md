### Note
This App is still a work in progress. It was made to showcase bootcamp skills but the concept is solid and capable of being built upon.  A direction for future development would include the ability to upload pictures, or pair user generated Title with an API call to gather details like cover art. Additionally, increased quality of life classifications like tags to aid in searches or groupings.
